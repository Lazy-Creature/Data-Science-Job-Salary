# Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict salaries based on various job-related features using machine learning models. The dataset includes key attributes such as job experience level, employment type, company size, and more. The objective is to build a regression model that predicts annual salaries in USD and evaluate its performance.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the salary of employees based on features such as experience level, employment type, job title, company size, and more. Machine learning models, particularly regression models, are trained and evaluated for this task.

## Dataset Information
The dataset consists of **607 entries** with **12 columns** related to job roles and salaries. Key features include:

- **Experience Level**: Job experience categories (EN, MI, SE, EX).
- **Employment Type**: Type of employment (FT, PT, CT, FL).
- **Job Title**: Role of the employee (e.g., Data Scientist, Analyst).
- **Company Size**: Size of the company (S, M, L).
- **Salary (USD)**: Annual salary in US dollars.
- **Company Location and Employee Residence**: Geographical information.
- **Remote Ratio**: Percentage of remote work.

## Data Loading and Exploration
In this step, the dataset is loaded and basic checks are performed:

- Shape of the dataset
- Data types and null values
- Display a few sample rows for understanding the data

## Data Preprocessing
This section handles the necessary steps for preparing the dataset:

- Drop unnecessary columns.
- Handle missing values (if any).
- Encode categorical variables.
- Detect and handle outliers.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this phase, we explore the dataset to understand the relationships between variables:

- Visualize the salary distribution.
- Examine correlations between features and the target variable (Salary).
- Explore patterns in the data that may affect salary predictions.

## Model Building
The data is split into training and testing sets. Multiple regression models are trained, including:

- **Decision Tree Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **Gradient Boosting Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model is evaluated on the test set to identify the best-performing model.

## Model Evaluation and Comparison
Performance metrics are calculated for each model to evaluate their accuracy in predicting salaries:

- **R²** (Coefficient of Determination)
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

A comparison of the models is made to determine the most promising approaches for salary prediction.

## Conclusion
The Gradient Boosting and KNN models provide the best results in terms of prediction accuracy. However, the **R²** values indicate that there is room for improvement, which could be achieved through further **feature engineering** or **hyperparameter tuning**.
